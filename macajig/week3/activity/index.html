    <P class="par3">When you create <span class="span2">pictures, charts, or diagrams, </span>they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting
            of  selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the <span class=" span3">selected text </span>from the <span class=" span4">Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. </span></P>

    <h1 class="head3">FORMAT TEXT</h1>
    <p class=" par4">You can also format <span class="span5">directly </span> text by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the
current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall look of your document, choose new <span class="span6">Theme elements</span> on
                                                                                                                                                                the Page Layout tab.</p>
 <p>To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and
the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the look of your document to the original contained in
your current template. On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your
document. </p>
